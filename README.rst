=============================
lenstronomy extensions
=============================


Deploys lenstronomy applications, examples and analysis scripts for lens modelling

Acompanies lenstronomy release version 1.10.3. ``lenstronomy`` is available through the pypi packaging index:
>>> pip install lenstronomy --user
If you are using the GitHub branch of ``lenstronomy``, you may be a bit ahead of the notebooks.
Get in touch with Simon Birrer (sibirrer@gmail.com) if you encounter problems.

Mailing list and Slack channel
------------------------------

You can join the **lenstronomy** mailing list by signing up on the
`google groups page <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lenstronomy>`_.


The email list is meant to provide a communication platform between users and developers. You can ask questions,
and suggest new features. New releases will be announced via this mailing list.

We also have a `Slack channel <https://lenstronomers.slack.com>`_ for the community.
Please send me an `email <sibirrer@gmail.com>`_ such that I can add you to the channel.


If you encounter errors or problems with **lenstronomy**, please let us know!


Shapelet reconstruction demonstration movies
--------------------------------------------

We provide some examples where a real galaxy has been lensed and then been reconstructed by a shapelet basis set.

* `HST quality data with perfect knowledge of the lens model <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/true_reconstruct.mp4>`_
* `HST quality with a clump hidden in the data <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/clump_reconstruct.mp4>`_
* `Extremely large telescope quality data with a clump hidden in the data <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/TMT_high_res_clump_reconstruct.mp4>`_
